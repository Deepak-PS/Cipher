# Caesar Cipher Algorithm

This application performs encoding and decoding of the given strings with the specified number of iterations. Only the strings in the US ASCII format are accepted. The strings are case-sensitive.

Encoding 'Z' with one rotation gives 'A' and vice-versa.

# Example

Encoding: For the string "ZIXJYZ" with 5 rotations, the encoder produces "ENCODE" string.

Decoding: For the string "IJHTIJ" with 5 rotations, the decoder produces "DECODE" string.
